    <p>Welcome! You have stumbled upon my personal domain.</p>

    <p>I use this domain primarily for the email address, but have slowly been
    populating it with my interests.</p>

    <p>A lot of the stuff I do is available on <a href="https://github.com/JoshDreamland">my GitHub page</a>.

    <p>I also finally made an actual "<a href="about.php">about me</a>" page,
    because someone actually asked. I think they asked out of a sort of general
    curiosity about how I might respond to the request, but I'll take it.

    <p>«Something about tacos»</p>
